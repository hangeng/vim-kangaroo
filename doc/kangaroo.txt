INTRODUCTION                                    *kangaroo*

Kangaroo provides a jump stack onto which positions can be manually
pushed and popped. A push onto the jump stack remembers the current
cursor position, and a pop jumps back to the most recently saved
position. Each window has its own jump stack.
