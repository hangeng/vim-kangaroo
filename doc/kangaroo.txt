INTRODUCTION                                    *kangaroo*

Kangaroo provides a jump stack onto which positions can be manually
pushed and popped. A push onto the jump stack remembers the current
cursor position, and a pop jumps back to the most recently saved
position.

MAPPINGS                                        *kangaroo-mappings*

zp                      Push current cursor position onto the jump
                        stack.

zP                      Pop most recent cursor position off the stack
                        and return to it.
